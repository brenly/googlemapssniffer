# googlemapssniffer

A non profit reached out to me and said "Hey, we need someone that can generate a bunch of thumbnail images of physical locations. We have 380 some GPS coordinates in a large list. We want them to put them on our website in a scrollable fashion. Can you solve this problem for us?" I said alright.

this script pulls gps coordinates from a csv file and looks them up on google maps. pulls a screen shot, and stores the images by Latitude, Longitude, and Site name..
the finished website containing the images outputted from this script can be found at
