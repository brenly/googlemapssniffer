# googlemapssniffer

A non profit reached out to me and said "Hey, we need someone that can generate a bunch of thumbnail satellite images of gps coordinates"

this script pulls gps coordinates from a csv file and looks them up on google maps. pulls a screen shot, and stores the images by Latitude, Longitude, and Site name..
the finished website containing the images outputted from this script can be found at
